Dear Luke,

we prepared a revision of our manuscript
  "Model-based Recursive Partitioning"
addressing the points raised by the referees. In particular, we
made the following enhancements:

  o The description of the algorithm in Section 3 and its first
    application within the paper to a real data set in Section 4.1
    are given in more detail now, showing more clearly what
    exactly is the optimization problem and how the algorithm
    tries to solve it by forward search.
    
  o More insights for the parameter instability tests are provided,
    both by theoretical arguments and empirical evaluation on
    simulated data. In Section 3.2, we compare the theoretical
    properties of the tests with those employed by other (linear)
    model trees such as GUIDE and RD/RA trees. In Section 5, we
    also illustrate that the theoretical properties can be confirmed
    in a simulation setup.
    
  o A new "Discussion" section has been added (Section 5) that
    discusses several details or potential extensions of the
    algorithm such as unbiasedness, pruning or applicability to
    large data sets.
    
A detailed point-to-point reply to the referees is included below.

I've put up a ZIP archive containing an unblinded and blinded version
of the paper at

Best wishes,

We have included such a discussion in the new Section 5 "Discussion". In
short, unbiasedness is achieved because all parameter instability tests
employed are level-alpha tests (i.e., control type I error when there is
no association with the partitioning variables) that are consistent for
arbitrary patterns of parameter change (i.e., are consistent at rate
sqrt(n)).

As already pointed out above, the parameter instability tests employed in
the algorithm are omnibus tests that are consistent against arbitrary patterns
of parameter changes. Additionally, their power is directed specifically
against abrupt parameter changes (as can be captured by partitioning). This
is now pointed out more clearly in Section 3 and 5, and is also backed by
an empirical comparison with residual-based tests as employed by GUIDE.

Although these are good reasons for using the specific testing functionals
from Equation (6) and (7), respectively, no testing functional will uniformly
dominate all others over all conceivable patterns of parameter change. This
is also pointed out within the paper in Sections 3 and 5.

We have added a paragraph in the new Section 5 "Discussion" that highlights
several issues and strategies when practitioners want to apply the algorithm
to large(r) data sets.

These have all been included in the revised paper.

The model is a linear regression model
  subscriptions = b0 + b1 * log(price/citation)
which is the same in all nodes of the trees, only with different coefficients b0
and b1. age <= 18 is the best split (in terms of error-sum-of-squares reduction)
of the model above when segmented into two sub-samples. Thus, the objective 
function (Psi = sum of squares) that is minimized by the estimator for (b0, b1)
is also (locally) optimized in the splitting step.

Section 4.1 provides now a more detailed discussion of how the algorithm is
applied to the journals data set.

Our motivation to start work on this algorithm was to be able to build local
regression models based on recursive partitioning algorithms. Hence, the focus
in the illustrations section is on partitioning three different types of
regression models: linear, logistic, censored Weibull.

As there is nothing in the formulation of the algorithm that would prevent its
application to other parametric models, we have introduced it without confining
ourselves to the regression framework.

The algorithm as suggested and illustrated by us does certainly not provide a
black-box procedure: all steps of the algorithm can be intuitively understood
and the resulting model effectively visualized and interpreted. To emphasize
this point, we have extended Section 4.1, providing more details on the 
fitting process of the algorithm to the journals data. This should help to
bring out more clearly how the general theoretical algorithm from Section 3
can be applied to a particular model class.

As for the comparison between MOB and GUIDE in terms of selecting the splitting
variable, we have included both theoretical and empirical comparisons, see
below.

Of course, we do not believe that MOB will uniformly dominate any other learning
algorithm over all conceivable data sets. Part of the explanation that MOB
performs well on the data sets in Section 4 is that for these data sets 
plausible models were available that could be employed for recursive partitioning.
The reason for not including further standard benchmark data sets (e.g., from
the UCI repository) was that no plausible models were available that could be
recursively partitioned.

We have extended the discussion of the parameter instability tests (and the
resulting unbiasedness of the recursive partitioning algorithm) both by
theoretical and empirical justifications. The reasons for using Andrews'
supLM test are: (1) it has a natural interpretation because it assesses
all potential change points by means of the corresponding LM statistic,
(2) it appropriately corrects for selecting the maximal LM statistic
(by employing a functional central limit theorem), (3) directs its power
against abrupt changes in parameters (as captured by the partitioning
algorithm). This is explained more thoroughly in Section 3 and compared
to the tests used by GUIDE by theoretical arguments. These are complemented
in Section 5 by a simulation study that highlights why using the full
model scores instead of the residuals only (i.e., the first element of the
scores in linear regression models) has power against a wider class of
parameter changes.

This is a very good suggestion: both the application to models estimated
by robust M-estimators as well as application to economic data sets are very
interesting. We definitely plan to investigate both ideas; however, as both
are beyond the scope of the manuscript under review, we refrain from including
them here.

We have included a paragraph in the new Section 5 "Discussion" about different
pruning strategies that can be employed for model-based recursive partitioning
(specifically cross-validation and information criteria). However, as such
pruning would compromise the intuitive interpretation of the p values
associated with the selected partitioning variables, we do not employ pruning
in the empirical examples. Furthermore, the adopted pre-pruning strategy
seems to work sufficiently well (outperforming the other tree-based algorithms
on the presented data sets) confirming the results from the CTree benchmark
of Hothorn et al. (2006) who also used a statistically motivated stopping
criterion.

As already pointed out above, the model itself does not change during the
partitioning process, only the fitted parameters vary across different
segments. We have extended both the theoretical description in Section 3
and the first application in Section 4 to bring this out more clearly.

It is the median number of parameters (over the bootstrap replications).
This is stated now in the first paragraph of Section 4 and the table
captions.

The notation in Section 3 is explained more carefully, the index sets I_b
and I_c are defined separately when they occur for the first time.
